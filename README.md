# Final Year Project

IOT Based Air Quality Monitoring System Using Machine learning Algorithm

## Software Used 
    1. Arduino Ide : It was used to calibrate MQ135 and MQ2 gas sensor , in interfacing 16X2 LCD ,
                     DHt11 and also to connect with the nearby hotspot

    2. ThingSpeak : ThingSpeak is an IOT analytics platform service that allows to aggregate,
                    visualize and analyse live data streams in the cloud. ThingSpeak provides
                    instant visualizations of data posted by the IOT devices to ThingSpeak server.
    
    3. Jupyter Notebook : Jupyter Notebook (formerly IPython Notebooks) is a web-based interactive 
                          computational environment for creating Jupyter notebook documents.
